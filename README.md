My name is Ally, a year nine student from Australia. As I am only in year nine, I am rather new to the world of coding, as I started only a few years ago on Swift. Since then, I have started learning other languages such as Python, Scratch and C++ (bad decision). As of right now, I am learning and coding in Python (it was the easiest so I thought I might as well start with that), but would love to learn new languages as I get better such as JavaScript, C, C#, etc. 

Recently, my brother, father and myself have created an idea for a video game which we hope to start making soon in Unity!
