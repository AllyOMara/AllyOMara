My name is Ally, a year nine student from Australia. As I am only in year nine, I am rather new to the world of coding (at least, with Python. I have had a bit of past experience with Swift). As of right now, I am learning (and coding) in Python, but would love to learn new languages as I get better such as JavaScript, C, C++ etc.


I hope you enjoy looking at my projects! Stay cool, chucklenuts ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
